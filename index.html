  Run, run, go!

          <strong>This simple test</strong> is produced to drive beginners
          crazy, making them hate CSS even more then they used to,
          when started to learn front-end development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At one moment during this code inspection task,<mark>
            you will probably think about why couldn't you just take that Python
            class at Udemy, and save yourself from this nightmare.</mark
          >
          But don't despair! There is always a second chance. You can always go
          back and start learning Python realizing that, before all of this pain
          you could just take that Social Media Marketing course and use
          keyboard for typing meaningful text.
        </p>

        <p class="outdated">
          Everyone just loves CSS, and never thinks about installing those
          wonderful crapy libraries, which will give him one time satisfaction,
          before he wishes he never started developing anything.
